                <p>
                    Web-based developers will be unlikely to consider C when building a web-based application. There are three primary reasons: First, C predates the modern Internet and was never designed for web-based development. Second, C is a low-level language with verbose syntax, which doesn't lend itself to rapidly building a web-based application. Third, a popular web-based framework has never emerged for developers.

                <p>
                    Web developers commonly learn C++ to gain low-level control of machine resources. Although this level of control may be unnecessary for most web developers, it will prove extremely valuable for performance critical applications, such as video games.

                <h2>Java</h2>
                <p>
                    Web-based developers use and learn Java for many reasons, but I will highlight just two of them: mobile development and formal education. The first reason refers to Java's use for building Android-based applications. The second reason relates to Java's adoption in colleges and universities to teach computer science concepts.
